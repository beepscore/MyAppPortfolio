## Android device
Nexus 4 running Android 5.1.1

# Results

## Background
Launcher app to launch other apps I will build in course.

## Android version
In build.gradle, specify
        minSdkVersion 22
        targetSdkVersion 22

For release build, probably would want to reduce minSdkVersion so more users can run app.

## Project name
I named project without spaces "MyAppPortfolio".  
Plan to change display name to include spaces "My App Portfolio".
